<p>Latest update: 10-18-2018</p>

<p> This page lists restaurants that we know and either love or hate
in Pittsburgh. The opinions here are our own, and try to be as honest
and brief as possible. The listing is alphabetical. Ratings are:

<dl>
<dt>
<p>
<font color="red">Red Name</font>: Stay away.
<dt>
<p>
<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> A good place.
<dt>
<p>
<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> A really good place.
</dl>

<p>
For places where we disagree, the final rating is up to the judgement of the editor.
Places  marked with a (*) are second hand from people we mostly trust.
</p>

<br>

<dl>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> 21st Street Coffee</b> - Downtown. </dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: The Cortado here is perhaps the best espresso and milk drink in the city. A store for coffee geeks run by coffee geeks.
<p>
Anukul: The cortado is sublime; nitro cold brew or an affogato are a delight. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b>61C Cafe</b> - Murray Ave,
  at the bus stop</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Coffee isn't great, but the place is nice.<br>
<p>Roger: Too open for me--I don't want to hear the couple next to me fighting.
<p>Anukul: All scene, no bean.
<p>peterb: Meh.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Abay</b> - Shady Ave. at Penn, near Whole Foods(<b>Closed</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Ethiopian food. They get points just for being there. This is not my personal thing, but people I trust like it.
<p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Ali Baba</b> - Oakland, Craig St.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Used to be the only middle eastern food around here. Now it's just one of several lame places.
<p>
Roger (<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>): My Israeli friend thinks it's lame, but it's my favorite Middle Eastern food. Yummy baba ganoush and sleek. Good with kids.
<p>
Anukul: Tastes better if you're a student.
<p>
Paul: A bowl of the Syrian soup and a shared small plate of baba ganooj make
for a reasonable lunch.  The former is pretty good.  The latter is
variable, but never bad.
<p>peterb: Try the Sleek.  My biggest problem with this place is that even when no one is in it, it is tragically overcrowded and uncomfortable.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Alihan's</b> - Downtown</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<p>Pete: Good kebabs and a transcendant roasted eggplant and pepper salad. Go before baseball games.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Alla Famiglia</b> - Allentown</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<p>Roger: Scary neighborhood, top notch Italian food, in a pleasant room with great
  service.
Easy to spend $150 for a couple. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Atria's</b> - North side, other places</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Steaks, burgers, general american food, good service, great with kids.
<p>Roger: A little too much like TGIF for me.
<p>peterb: The beer is overpriced, and the food is "OK" but not memorable.  It's a good place for work-related lunches, for some reason.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> B52 Cafe</b> - Upper Lawrenceville</dt>
<dd>
<p>jamief: Middle Eastern Vegan with a great brunch that opens nice and early. Make sure to try the house-made harissa, the baba ganouj, and the buckwheat pancakes. Actually. everything I had there was fantastic.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Baba D's</b> - Carson Street, South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>rlink: Good Middle Eastern.  Often tempted to just have the hummus, baba, grape leaves, tabbouleh, feta, and olives platter for dinner.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Bahn Mi and Ti</b> - Lawrenceville</dt>
<dd>
<p>psu: Good Bahn Mi sandwiches and great rice bowls.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Bangkok Balcony</b> - Squill, Forbes ave.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Reasonable Thai at reasonable price.  But, now that Rose Tea is open there is no reason to go here. <br>
<p>Roger: We concur.</b></p>
<p>Anukul: OK but no longer exceptional thai; same owner as silk elephant which is similar but different.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Berlin Street Food</b> - Food Truck (Closed)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: The best sausage in town. Get the bratwurst sandwich, the currywurst, or the lamb sandwich. All good.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Bona Terra</b> - Sharpsburg (Closed)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: A good place for any city. Recommended.
<p>
Roger: Surprisingly high end for Pittsburgh. One of the city's few real restaurants, kind of like a real city would have.
</dd>

<dt><b> Bossa Nova</b> - 7th Avenue, Downtown</dt>
<dd>
<p>rlink: Competent food and tapas, good wine.  Allows cigarette and cigar smoking, so the PA smoking ban means that no one under 21 is allowed inside, ever.  Completely dead after happy hour.  Charlie Batch drinks appletinis here.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><font color="red">Bravo</font> - Everywhere</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Mediocre pasta and such. Offensively expensive.<br>
<p>Roger: Just downright sucky.
<p>peterb: It's a tasteless, soulless chain, but to make up for it, the prices are really high.</p>
</p>
</dd>

<dt><B><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> BRGR</b> - East Side, Near Whole Foods</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: The Spoon people do fancy burgers. Great toppings, OK meat. Excellent fries. 
</dd>

<dt><B> Burgatory</b> - Waterworks</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Started out as the second best of the new fancy burger joints, but has become inconsistent, especially in the suburbs. Go to Butterjoint.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Butterjoint</b> - North Craig St, Oakland</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: The bar next to Legume. Nice bar, and you get to have the Legume food too. This is currently the best place in Pittsburgh to get a burger.
<p>Anukul: A great bar: bluefish pate, pierogies, and a mercy of the bartender.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Cafe at the Frick (Clayton)</b> - North of the Frick Museum</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Great desserts, soup, sandwiches, lunch, sunday tea. Make reservations.<br>
<p>Roger: One of the best places in town. You can only make reservations if you're a member.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: The Chef here recently retired, I have not been back since and cannot say if things are different.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Cafe Grand Canal</b> - Sharpsburg</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Excellent pasta, transcendent cannelloni with ground veal and bechemal.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Cafe Du Jour</b> - South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Interesting, decent food served by total flakes.
</p>
<p>
Anukul:  Great for lunch (sausage & brie sandwich!), usually good for dinner but potentially inconsistent.  The outdoor garden is one of the better settings to eat.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><font color="red">Cafe Zinho</font> - Shadyside</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Seems interesting at first, until you realize it isn't. Extremely inconsistent.<br>
<p>Roger: Owned by the Baum Vivant charmers. Bad hotel food in a funky setting created by
the previous owner (who actually had a personality). One of Pittsburgh's top
restaurant critics described the owner in terms I will not repeat in decent company. Told you
not to get me started. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Casa Reyna</b> - Penn Ave., Strip</dt>
<dd>
<p>
jamief: Good tacos in the Strip.
</p>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: An enjoyable assortment of other Mexican dishes as well.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Casbah</b> - In Shadyside on Highland Ave.
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Reasonably good mediterranean-ish food. Too often more expensive than it
  is worth.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: A reliably nice place to take company, if you don't mind the big ticket
  (big for Pittsburgh, anyway). Sunday brunch is good too.
<p>
Paul: All about the brunch for us, particularly during the warmer months in
the "patio" area.  They use actual yogurt on the granola.
</p>
 <p>rlink:  Okay, but every single dish has one ingredient that
really doesn't belong in it, overpowering everything else.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Casta Rasta</b> - Shadyside(<b>Closed</b>), South Hills</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Mexican mixed with Jamaican food. Also, Avocado Fries. AVOCADO FRIES. The East Liberty location is closed.
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Chatellier's French Bakery</b> - Millvale</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Best straight up croissant in the city. Also get the Kouign Amann
(pronounced kween a-mon)</p>
<p>Anukul: The kouign amann and breton cake are unreal.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Chaya</b> - Murray Ave, halfway down the hill.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good Sushi and other Japanese food. Nice hot pots. Get the live scallop
  if they have it.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: One of Pittsburgh's better sushi places. </p>
  <p>Anukul: Great sushi and broiled fish; I don't think the chef scolds anyone about wasabi any more.
</dd>

<dt><font color="red">Cheesecake Factory</font> - South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: I don't understand these places. Why sit in a 2 hour line to get mediocre food and an oversized piece of cheesecake?
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Chiarina's</b> - South Side (<b>Closed</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Anukul: They had wonderful sleek.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Chiodo's </b> - Homestead (<b>Closed</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Great dive bar. Lots of beer. Try the Mystery Meat Sandwich, which is a great value.
<p>
Roger: Typical bar food but a great beer selection and a pleasant place to hang out.
<p>peterb: I believe this place has closed, unfortunately.  It wasn't good, but it was cheap.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Christo's</b> - Sixth Street</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good Greek food. Get the "Jackie O" cake.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b> The Church Brew Works</b> - Liberty Ave</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: A beer place. I never found the food that great.
  <p>Roger: A fine brew pub. Poor acoustics is my only complaint. </p>
<p>
Paul: A divided space between a high-rent bill of fare and
pub food, plus a collection of decent beers.  Loud.
The pepperoni pizza is a surprising win, and all the
desserts involve malt in some fashion.
</p>
<p>rlink: The pizzas are okay, but the entrees try too hard
and fall short.  Now that Pittsburgh is no longer a beer wasteland, the
brewpub aspect is less exciting.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Clem's BBQ</b> - Way east</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Decent ribs. The pulled pork is OK, but doesn't taste like real southern
  barbequeue.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Coca Cafe</b> - Lawrenceville</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Where hip pre-gentrified Lawrencville neighborhood people go for good breakfast.</p>
<p>peterb: I think the breakfasts here are pretty good, and there's a variety of options and OK coffee.  There's a bit of a lack of yummy meat options, but the interesting omelettes and panini make up for it.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Coffee Tree</b> - Squill, Forbes Ave, other places</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Brewed coffee is consistently excellent. Espresso is uneven. Good hot chocolate.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: I don't drink coffee but the wife loves it. </p>
  <p>Anukul: Their light roast single origin used to be a safe bet but there are now much better choices in town.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Colangelo's Bakery</b> - Strip, next to La Prima</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: In Antonio's old space. Nice lunches, some of the same baked goods. The pizza isn't the same.
<p>
peterb: Try the almond mele.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Commonplace Coffee</b> - Friendship, Squirrel Hill</dt>
<dd>
<p>
jamief: Amazing espresso drinks, and very good brewed coffee. Beans are excellent as well. Not a huge variety of baked goods, but the ones they have are good.
<P>
Anukul: Great espresso, pourover, and beans with nice staff; the current pastry program is inconsistent (exception: the bacon morning bun).
<P>
peterb: The best coffee in Squirrel Hill right now. The atmosphere, however, is morose and tragic, like a reification of <em>The Sorrows Of Young Werther</em>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Crepes Parisienne</b> - Craig St.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: OK crepes, but too pricey.
</p>
<p>rlink:  I'd rather go here than Paris 66, but only
out of nostalgia for when it was a secret little place in a Shadyside
basement that nobody new about.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Cure</b> - Upper Lawrenceville</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Former Chef from Elements opens his own place. Probably the current best place in town for creativity and execution. Same great cured meats now combined with an excellent menu with an emphasis on meat. Also the second best chocolate dessert in town.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> D's Six Packs & Dogz</b> -  Regent Square</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Anukul: Amazing beer bottle selection and great rotating features on draft.  Good for a quick bite before an artsy movie.
</p>
<p>
Pete: Credible Chicago dog. Not crusty like I like them, and too much bun, but yummy. The fries are good. Actually better than the O fries.
</p>
<p>peterb: I actually think I prefer D's to the O.  A lot of that might be the atmosphere, and the superior selection of condiments.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Dave and Andy's </b> - Atwood St, Oakland</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Really really really good local ice cream shop. Don't go anywhere else
  for cones. If I see you in a Cold Stone or something, I'll cut you.
<p>Roger: Agree, but the room is coldly industrial at best. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> De Luca's</b> - Strip</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: One of the better breakfast places in the city, but nowhere near great.<br />
<p>Roger: Yummy 2,000 kcal breakfasts. </p>
<p>peterb: It's a pit, but it's a pit with really good bacon.  The coffee is substandard (and getting worse over time)</p>
<p>rlink:The people who line up for Pamela's have invaded.  Still
deliciously evil, but now there's a wait.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Dinette</b> - Shadyside, near Whole Foods</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: The pizza is super, but the real joy here is salads and starters. But don't miss the pizzas with pancetta and eggs. Second or third best place in town now.
</p>
<p>rlink: Great pizzas, small but decent wine selection.  As a
friend so eloquently put it, "Lit like the surface of the [expletive]
Sun."  My retinas will just have to suffer.
<P>Anukul: Crispy thin crust pizzas that highlight smart seasonal toppings.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Dish</b> - 17th Street, South Side (Closed, for now)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: A surreal zone of uber-hipness in the middle of the South Side. Great appetizers and mediterranean/Italian pasta, meat and seafood dishes. Really good, maybe my favorite in the city. They take credit cards now.
<p>
Anukul: Great but small space, great but small menu with consistently good specials (2-3/night), fun staff.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><font color="red"> Double-Wide Grille</font> - 24th and Carson, South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: This place is awful. It started out just mediocre and it got worse every time I went back. Avoid except maybe for the booze.
<p>rlink: Everyone raves about the food, but I can't see why.  I've never had a good meal here.  Good selection of beers on draught, and a HUGE patio.  The servers get cranky if you sit outside and don't order food, but I've never seen the same one twice, so I don't care.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Driftwood Oven</b> - 35th Street or so, Lawrenceville</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Best pizza in town right now. Also a transcendent mortadella sandwich.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> E2</b> - Bryant Street, Highland Park (Closed)</dt>
<dd>
<p>rlink: Great Saturday/Sunday breakfast and brunch.  Ever-changing menu of locally-sourced foods, from the rich to the rustic, sweet to the savoury.  Get the Tony-Bag-o'-Donuts (sourdough ginger donuts).
<p>Pete: This is "Kate who used to work at Enrico's back in the day"'s place. Good breakfast. Have also had some good Slow Food dinners there.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Eat 'n Park </b> - Everywhere</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Pete: Almost always open.  Great with kids.
      <br />
      <p>Roger: How can you review Eat 'n Park in this city? It's part of the &quot;culture.&quot;
      McDonald's with servers. I hate it. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Eat Unique</b> - Craig Street
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Used to be Craig Street coffee. Never order anything they don't already have made. One of the least effective service schemes ever devised for a restaurant lives here.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Eleven</b> - Smallman Street, Strip District</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: The first time I went I got bad fish. But since then it has been uniformly excellent. Bar menu has a remarkably good lobster roll. Go get it.
<p>rlink: It is impossible to have a bad meal here.  Expensive, but oh so worth it.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Enrico Biscotti</b> - 20th St. and Penn, Strip. </dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Great biscotti, cookies, and other delights. The cafe in the back, which was one of the best food places to ever exist in Pittsburgh is now open only on weekends.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Two of my favoriate places in the city. Top notch. </p>
  <p>Anukul: I'll miss the chaos of eating lunch in the Strip.</p>
<p>peterb: The place in Shadyside (note: closed) is exactly as bad as the place in the strip was good.  The food is almost the same, but the atmosphere is all wrong.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Enrico's Tazzo D'Oro</b> - Highland Park</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Not at all related to the other Enrico's. Good coffee, funky place. New outpost at CMU is also good.
<p>
Anukul: Good coffee, decent lunch fare, great place to read the sunday paper.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Espresso a Mano </b> - Butler Street in Lawrenceville</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Best cappuccino in the city. Matt the owner was the best guy La Prima had for years. Now he is on his own. Go here instead.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Everyday Noodles</b> - Forbes Ave, Squirrel Hill</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: A true first in Pittsburgh. Truly excellent and authentic hand-pulled noodles in a variety of soups, not to mention Shanghai soup dumplings and other authentic Chinese treats. Joins How Lee and Rose Tea as the Chinese food triumvirate in town. Do not go anywhere else. Ever.
</p>
<p>jamief: Love this place so much. Get the soup dumplings for sure, although everything on the menu is excellent. Try not to be startled when the chefs loudly slap their big hand-pulled noodles on the table as they're working.
<p>Anukul: Save room for the pan fried pork bun. 2 orders worth.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Fat Heads</b> - South Side, Carson and 18th or 19th.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good wings, lots of beer, huge sandwiches that don't suck much. Very loud.
<p>
Anukul Great bar food with great beer; the beasty barbecue sauce is perfection.
</p>
<p>peterb: Their wings have declined in quality dramatically over the past few years.  Stick to the sandwiches.</p>
<p>rlink:  If you miss the wings, get the Voodoo Killer Burger,
but don't tell your intestines that it was my idea.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Fish Nor Fowl</b> - Friendship</dt>
<dd>
<p>jamief: New DeShantz restaurant in the space where Salt of the Earth used to be. Very creative and delicious food, if somewhat inconsistent at times. They recently simplified the menu because the original menu required you to have a Ph.D. in Hipsterology to understand it.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Five Points Artisan Bakeshop</b> - Squirrel Hill</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good bread. Also good croissant. For brioche go to Gourmandine.
<p>
jamief: Awesome French bakery specializing in boulangerie. Best baguettes in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Anukul: Their seeded fougasse, cardamom sweet buns, and chocolate rye cookies highlight their super powers</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> FL.2</b> - Downtown</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: New relatively fancy restaurant and bar in the Fairmont Hotel downtown. Where Habitat used to be. Good straightforward things, though sometimes the price per unit food is confusing.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Frankfurters</b> - Lincoln Ave. in Bellevue (<b>Closed</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Great hot dogs. I like the O better.
</p>
<p>peterb: They have birch beer, and good hot dogs.  Not quite as great as D's.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Fukuda</b> - Liberty Ave. in Bloomfield (closed)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Small sushi joint with high standards. Also pretty good ramen. Part of a new generation of young hipster joints.
</p>
<p>rlink: Small. Hipster. But god DAMN can they make tasty food. Get the fish head.
<p><b>Note:</b> This place is closed.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Girasole (*)</b> - Shadyside</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Contributed: Good Italian, nice atmosphere, excellent ravioli and tiramisu. Smallish.
  LOUD.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Nice place that seriously needs some acoustic tiling. Competent food,
  good service. </p>
<p>
Paul: The trick to eating here is getting a table on the patio when the
weather is nice; considerably less noisy. We've never had a bad meal.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Gaucho Parrilla Argentina</b> - Strip</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Awesome grilled meat place. Also good salads and grilled veggies.
</p>
<p>Anukul: great meat. great sauces.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Green Forest</b> - 655 Rodi Rd.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: My friend Alex says, "If you are thinking 'Meat, meat.  I need more meat.  Where is the
damn meat?' this is a pretty good place."  The cold bar is more than
tolerable, too. <br />
<p>Roger: Did Pete mention the meat? Atkins heaven. Not half bad. </p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Green Pepper</b> - Murray Ave</dt>
<dd>
<p>Anukul: Spicy pork, red rice, and a nice selection of banchan.<br />
<p>peterb: The best of their stew dishes is the yuk gae jang, spicy beef stew.  Both the kimchi jigae and soon du bu are also credible, though not as good as Korea Garden.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><font color="red"> Grille on Seventh</font> - 7th Avenue, Downtown</dt>
<dd>
<p>rlink: When the waiter takes your nearly-untouched plate that you've pushed aside without asking what was wrong, and then openly scrapes it into the trash, you know they just don't care.  Likely survives on its proximity to the Benedum, Byham, and Heinz Hall.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Grit &amp; Grace</b> - Downtown (Closed)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: A new favorite in the Downtown area. Go for the goat curry, stay for the things involving pork. Wish they had a good salad.
<p>
jamief: Avoid the dim sum, but all the other food we got was great. Good service and atmosphere. Cocktails were disappointing.

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Il Pizzaiolo</b> - Mt. Leb, Market Square</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Brick oven Napoli-style pizza and fancy pasta plates. Pizza still isn't quite my thing, but the pasta dishes are now most excellent.  My previous recommendation to just go to RM doesn't work anymore, since RM is closed. Caruso's is also essentially dead. So there you go.
<p>

  <p>Roger: Silly name and equally silly decor, but one of the best seafood places in town.
  Awesome view. The bar is good too.</p>
<p>
Paul: One of the best meals I've ever had, sitting in the ghetto in back

<dt><b>My Thai</b> - Shadyside, 2nd floor, corner of Walnut and Aiken</dt>

<p>Roger: There are two Thai places in Shadyside. This is the better one by far.

Pete: Justin Severino's second place in town. More of a Spanish bent. Same strengths as Cure but I like his original place better. Bigger bar for people who are into that, especially gin and tonics.
</p>
<p>jamief: I've never liked this as much as Cure, but it's still very good. The acoustics are rough though and it can get very loud.</p>
</dd>

<dt><font color="red">Nakama</font> - Carson and 17th</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Roger: The cheesy Benihana schtick lives! Nakama is to Japanese cuisine as P.F. Chang's is to Chinese. Utterly lacking in subtlety and grace. Was that butter you just slathered on my over-grilled shrimp? On the other hand, the kid loved the goofy chef show.
 </p>
 <p>rlink:  Better sushi than available elsewhere on the South

one item per person.</p>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Noodlehead</b> - Highland Ave, Shadyside</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Yet another new noodle joint. That makes four this year. Eclectic blend of different street food style noodles. Good snack sizes.
</p>
<p>jamief: I love Noodlehead, though it's often very busy and they don't take reservations. They also don't take credit cards or make substitutions. 
  I guess you can pull that kind of stuff when the food is this good.</p>

<p>Pete: Good chicken soup, finally! Reuben Knish is a great thing.</p>
<p>jamief: This place is way better than it should be as a Pamela's spin-off. They've started only doing weekend brunch, which is still good, but it was better when they were open every day.</p>

  deep fried pancakes, nothing else that great.<br />
  <p>Roger: I concur. Gross. </p>
<p>
Paul: My body can no longer handle the grease.

<p>peterb: Everyone who stands on line to get in here on Saturday morning is going to Hell.</p>
<p>Anukul: It is technically possible to eat here without hating yourself but never wait in line for it.</p>
<p>jamief: Pamela's tastes good going down, but then I feel like crap the rest of the day. The Lyonnaise potatoes are great (but salty). Don't order too much!</p>

in the Strip if you order it wrong.
</p>
 <p>rlink:  Death by corned beef or by capicola?  If
only all decisions were this delicious.</p>
<p>peterb: The great secret of Primanti's is to go there in the morning and get a bacon-and-egg sandwich (or, if you're eating there, just a bacon and egg plate).  It's a yummy (if deadly) breakfast.</p>

<dt><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><b> Taiwanese Bistro Cafe 33</b> - East Carson St. South Side.</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: A second Taiwanese place around the corner from Rose Tea. I gather the owner used to work for Rose Tea. A great complimentary piece, as the two places do some different things, and have different strengths and weaknesses. Get the ground pork stir fry with Chinese chives.
</p>
<p>jamief: This place is great. Everything is very fresh, and I like it even more than Rose Tea, even though Rose Tea gets the PSU lifetime achievement award for upending Pittsburgh's Chinese food scene.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> The Steer and the Wheel</b> - Food Truck</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: This, along with the Butterjoint burger, takes over Tessaro's place as the burgers to get.
</dd>


<dt><b>Sushi Too</b> - Shadyside</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Warm sushi on bad rice. Never liked it. Note, the South Side location has opened under a different name recently.

<p>Roger (<img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/>): Friendly, reliable.
My default &quot;let's do sushi&quot; place. Not as yummy as Umi and Chaya, but cheaper and far easier to get into. </p>
<p>Anukul: The sushi is almost always nasty; stick to Shadyside location.  Haven't tried the korean.
<p>peterb: There are atmosphere differences between the two locations.  The people at the South Side location are nice and friendly and make you feel welcome.  The people at the Shadyside location hate you, and want you to die.</p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Taj Mahal</b> - McKnight Road, North Hills</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Nice North Indian. A good way to change things up if you go to Udipi or Tamarind too much.</p>
<p>rlink: Surprisingly good Indian for being located in the middle of what is arguably the Longest Strip Mall On Earth.</p>
<p>jamief: Really good North Indian lunch buffet with lots of variety.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Tamari</b> - Lawrenceville, Warrendale (<b>Closed</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Asian/Latin fusion. Really! Lobster "sushi" roll is to die for. Big bar. They are heros for opening in the North Hills as well. By far the best place to eat up there.
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Tamarind</b> - South Hills</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Great Indian food. There are a few of these now in various locations. The South Hills one is the best for the creative lunch buffet (really!). They make these lentil fritters (vada) that are to die for.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Tan lac Vien Vietnamese Bistro</b> - Murray Ave, Squill. </dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Good Pho with a rich tasty broth. Go here instead of Tram's.
</p>
<p>jamief: One of the only Vietnamese places I've ever been to with an extensive vegetarian menu, including a great vegetarian Pho. The lemongrass tofu is delicious, as are the vegetarian bun and com.</p>
<p>Anukul: Great bun and decent banh mi.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Taqueria Mi Mexico</b> - Murray Ave, Squill (<b>Closed</b>)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Great tacos and tortas. Other interesting Mexican dishes. Insanely cheap. Go now. A second nice Mexican place to go along with Taco Loco.
<p/>
<p>peterb: I love this place.  Although not on the menu, the soups (consomme, menudo) are great, when they have them.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Teppanyaki Kyoto</b> Highland Park</dt>
<dd>
<p>Anukul: Seasonal japanese and grilled favorites: yaki onigiri, takoyaki, and okonomiyaki. Good with kids.<br />
<p></p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Tessaro's</b> - Bloomfield, Liberty Ave</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Local bar. Great burgers. Among the best in the city. Can be slow.
  <br />
  <p>Roger: Good burgers but pretty everything else is mediocre. </p>
<p>
Paul: The burgers are all.  If you ask for a rare burger, they will actually
serve one.  Great tin ceilings.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Thin Man Sandwich Shop (Closed)</b> - 21st St., Strip</dt>
<dd>
<p>
jamief: Some of the best and most creative sandwiches in the city. The Thin Man sandwich is an excellent default but their seasonal items are usually great too.
</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Very yummy. Get anything with liver in it.
</dd>

<dt><B><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Toast!</b> - Baum Blvd. (<b>Closed</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Great wine bar, small plates and various foods with a style of their own. Certainly in the starting five of great places in Pittsburgh with a single word name.
</dd>

<dt><b> Tonic</b> - Downtown</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Nice bar with a mix of creative small and large dishes.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Tram's</b> - Bloomfield</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good Vietnamese food. Noodle bowls, some "special dishes". I have never found the Pho here special.
<br />
<p>Roger: Atmospherically scary, not for the faint of heart, which for me is a bonus
on top of the good food. </p>
<p>
Paul: Great pho, great spring rolls, great table coverings.
</p>
<p>peterb: I love this place.  There's not a lot of options vis-a-vis the pho (no tripe, for example), but the broth is superb.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Turkish Kebab House</b> - Squirrel Hill</dt>
<dd>
<p>
jamief: Finally a good Middle Eastern place in Pittsburgh. Very casual atmosphere, but the food is solid.
Anukul: The lamb adana kebab and fried eggplant with warm fresh bread are wonderful.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Udipi Cafe</b> - Old Willima Penn highway, Monroeville</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Probably won't get better Indian near here. Lots of traffic from
  the Temple. Good Dosa.
</p>
<p>
Paul: Utensils strictly optional.  Get the Paper Masala Dosai for a meal
that verges on the architectural.
</p>
<p>
peterb:  I second Paul's recommendation of the paper masala dosai. They have a lot on the menu, but I can never find a reason to get anything other than the superb dosai.
</p>
<p>jamief: Amazing South Indian / vegetarian. Also recommend the vegetable uthappa and the chana batura, which comes with a gigantic ellipsoid of deep-fried puffy bread.</p>
<p>Anukul: Wonderful greasy south indian snack food served with spicy sambar and chutneys.
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Umi</b> - Shadyside, Ellsworth</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: High end Japanese. Very expensive, very good. Unclear if it's worth it.
  The fixed price tasting menu (Omakase) is nice.
  <p />
  <p>Roger: My favoriate sushi, mostly because of atmosphere. </p>
  <p>Anukul: The omakase is an enjoyable splurge although not as dynamic as options in other cities.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Uncle Sam's</b> - Oakland, Squirrel Hill, others</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good cheesesteaks. Some gripe about the bread and/or the fries. The one
  in Oakland is better.
  <p />
  <p>Roger: Hate. </p>
<p>
peterb:Every time I eat here I feel vaguely ill. When I want a cheesesteak I go to Charlie's instead. I'm told this is some sort of political question.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Vendetta Dolci (*)</b> - South Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Contributed: Italian/Mediterranean place started by the former pastry chef from
   Abruzzi. High-end food at middle-of-the-road prices, never a long
wait for a table. Great desserts.  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
<b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Vivo</b> - Bellevue now Sewickley
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pete: Landmark place in the late 90s and early 2000s. Now closed and replaced by something else that is not as good. Apparently has moved to Sewickley, but I have not been there.
<p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Waffalonia</b> Squirrel Hill, Schenley Plaza</dt>
<dd>
<p>Anukul: Inconsistent liege waffles but consistently great Dave & Andy's ice cream including the wonderful custom Speculoos flavor. <br />
<p></p>
</dd>


<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Yo Rita</b> - Carson Street, Southside(<b>Closed</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<P>Pete: Foofy tacos, a bit uneven overall, some interesting ideas but I wish they had corn tortillas. </p>
<p>rlink: Really good oddball tacos.  Softshell crab, sweetbreads, lamb, duck, rocky mountain oysters, b&aacute;nh m&igrave;.  Loses a star for the surly owner who sits at the bar and stares at patrons.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b> Zarra's</b> - Bigelow Boulevard, North Oakland</dt>
<dd>
<p>rlink: Hearty traditional Southern Italian.  Good homemade sausage.  The dining room is distractingly packed with kitchy antiques.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><img src="bullet.jpg" alt="*"/> Zaw's</b> - Murray Ave, down the hill.(<b>Closed</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Pete: Good Asian takeout in Squirell Hill. Closed in 2015, which is sad for all of us.
  <p>Roger: On the oily side, but tasty. </p>
  <p>peterb: The only reason to go here is if you are too poor to afford Rose Tea.</p>
  <p> rlink:  The only "Chinese" place where I will stoop to
ordering General Tso's.  It's that good.  I don't know what anything
else on the menu tastes like.</p>
